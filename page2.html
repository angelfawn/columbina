    <h1>thank you so much for visiting this website!</h1>
    <p>
      i’ve been super duper excited for columbina ever since the winter night lazzo trailer, and i’ve been saving up for her for over a year now! i did end up going for skirk, so part of me hopes they’ll work well together haha!

      i really hope bina ends up being a dps or sub-dps. honestly, i’m getting her either way, but i’d love for her to have some dps capabilities (maybe through her constellations if she turns out to be a support) ♡ i wanna see her on-field alllll the time. i mean, we’ve all been patiently waiting for her for so long, barely seeing her, so it just feels right.
